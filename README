Reload tries to do as little as possible for you. It is a loader, not a versioning system or repository. You are the one responsible for versioning and setting up your file system. The more work that is already done the faster Reload can work, as such I only included a few features for efficiency.

As a general rule of thumb you will want to structure your library directory in a logical and well defined manner. Most plugins do not follow the same standards, as such I don't rely on them. It is up to the maintainer to setup standards.

Support for versioning might be included in a future version of Reload.js
